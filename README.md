---

## **📌 Checkpoints in `fine_tuned_model` Directory**  

The `fine_tuned_model` directory contains multiple **checkpoints**, which are snapshots of the model at different stages during the fine-tuning process. These checkpoints store the weights, configurations, and tokenizer settings, ensuring that the model can be resumed from any stage or used for inference.

---

### **🛠️ What is a Checkpoint?**
A **checkpoint** is a saved state of a machine learning model that includes:  
✔ **Model Weights** - The trained parameters learned during fine-tuning.  
✔ **Optimizer State** - Stores training progress, learning rate adjustments, and gradient updates.  
✔ **Tokenization Configuration** - Preserves the vocabulary and tokenization settings.  
✔ **Training Progress** - Ensures the model can resume training from where it left off.  

---

### **📂 Structure of `fine_tuned_model`**
The directory consists of multiple files that store different aspects of the trained model:

| **File / Folder** | **Description** |
|------------------|----------------|
| `checkpoint-*`  | Stores trained weights at different steps in training (e.g., `checkpoint-8`, `checkpoint-16`, `checkpoint-24`). |
| `config.json`  | Configuration file containing model architecture details (e.g., layer size, activation functions). |
| `generation_config.json` | Stores generation-specific parameters like temperature, max tokens, and top-p settings. |
| `merges.txt` | A file used by the tokenizer to merge subword tokens efficiently. |
| `model.safetensors` | The main model file storing weights in a safe and optimized format. |
| `pytorch_model.bin` | The PyTorch-compatible model weights (may not be present if `safetensors` format is used). |
| `special_tokens_map.json` | Defines special tokens like `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, `[PAD]`, etc., used by the tokenizer. |
| `tokenizer_config.json` | Stores tokenizer settings such as padding, truncation, and pre-tokenization rules. |
| `tokenizer.json` | The actual vocabulary and tokenizer model, defining tokenization behavior. |
| `vocab.json` | A JSON file containing token-to-ID mappings, ensuring consistent tokenization. |

---

### **🧠 Understanding the Checkpoints (`checkpoint-*`)**
Each checkpoint (e.g., `checkpoint-8`, `checkpoint-16`) represents the model **at a specific step** during training. The number in the checkpoint folder name corresponds to the number of **training steps** completed.  

💡 **Example:**
- `checkpoint-8` → Model weights saved after 8 training steps.
- `checkpoint-16` → Model weights saved after 16 training steps.
- `checkpoint-24` → Model weights saved after 24 training steps.

🔍 **How to Use Checkpoints:**
- If training crashes or is interrupted, the model can be resumed from the latest checkpoint.
- Different checkpoints allow experimentation with models at various training stages.
- The best-performing checkpoint can be selected based on accuracy and loss metrics.

---

### **📌 How Checkpoints Improve Model Performance**
1. **Incremental Training:** Instead of training from scratch every time, we can continue from a previous checkpoint.  
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Allows testing different configurations (batch size, learning rate) without restarting.  
3. **Model Selection:** Helps in choosing the best model version for deployment based on accuracy, loss, and other evaluation metrics.  
4. **Backup & Recovery:** Ensures that training progress isn’t lost due to crashes or interruptions.  

---

### **🚀 Loading a Checkpoint for Inference**
To load a specific checkpoint and use it for generating responses, run the following:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

MODEL_PATH = "backend/fine_tuned_model/checkpoint-16"  # Change to desired checkpoint

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH)

print("✅ Model loaded successfully from", MODEL_PATH)
```
This ensures that the AI loads the **best checkpoint** rather than the initial pre-trained version.

---

### **🎯 Choosing the Best Checkpoint**
To determine the most accurate checkpoint, evaluate them using **loss and accuracy metrics**.  
You can compare them by running:

```python
import torch

model_path_1 = "backend/fine_tuned_model/checkpoint-8"
model_path_2 = "backend/fine_tuned_model/checkpoint-16"

model_1 = torch.load(f"{model_path_1}/pytorch_model.bin")
model_2 = torch.load(f"{model_path_2}/pytorch_model.bin")

print("Checkpoint-8 Parameters:", len(model_1))
print("Checkpoint-16 Parameters:", len(model_2))
```
This helps in selecting the most optimized checkpoint for inference.

---

### **📌 Conclusion**
The `fine_tuned_model` directory is crucial for storing the AI's learned knowledge, and **checkpoints** enable **incremental learning, optimization, and recovery**. By selecting the best-performing checkpoint, NimbusAI ensures **efficient, accurate, and scalable** AI responses. 🚀
